#### ōryōki

---

Ōryōki [応量器] is an **experimental** web browser with a thin interface.

Use it to quietly browse the Internet, archive and capture visuals. Use it to tune down the noise—so maybe don’t use it too often.

Ōryōki is an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) app, meaning that it more or less renders like Chrome, and that all websites are safely sandboxed in a `webview`. Only for MacOS (for now).
