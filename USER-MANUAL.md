#### title bar
Toggle with `CMD+/` for a frameless window.

#### night mode
The interface color theme can be toggled between light & dark (`CMD+CTRL+N`). This happens automatically when visiting a website, based on the page’s luminance. This option can be changed in preferences.

#### windows
Windows can float on top of all others. `CMD+ALT+M` allows to enter window dimensions. Holding `ALT` allows to drag windows around.

#### filters
Webview can be inverted (`CMD+I`) or put in grayscale (`CMD+G`).

#### search dictionary
`CMD+L` brings up the omnibox. The search dictionary allows to search directly for wikipedia articles, images, dev docs, etc. The dictionary is entirely customizable, so you can add your own.

#### devtools
`CMD+ALT+I` for Chrome devtools.

#### mini console
Bring up with `CMD+ALT+C`. Only displays the last message (for now). Supports javascript execution in the web page.

#### notifications
Shows loading status and some useful action feedback. Recording mutes notifications.

#### picture in picture
Ōryōki fullscreens in the window (not the screen) by default. This option can be changed in preferences.

#### preferences
For default interface state, behavior and paths options. Preferences are stored in a json file and can be reset to factory settings.

#### screen grab
Save to downloads with `CMD+~`. `CMD+SHIFT+C` to copy to clipboard.

#### metadata
Ōryōki saves the source url and title of a website in the PNG's tEXt chunks. Saved screen grabs can be opened (`CMD+O`) or dropped on the omnibox to revisit the website captured.

#### video recording
Requires ffmpeg for encoding. Supports `prores` and `mp4` quality preferences. Ōryōki looks for ffmpeg in /usr/local/bin.

#### updates
Ōryōki will ping you when an update is available. Updates can be downloaded in the background. One just need to replace the .app once the update is downloaded.
